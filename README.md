# Dangerous Functions 

# Description
Inspired from Chris Eagle's IDA Pro Book (1st Edition), this is an IDC script that relies on a dangerous functions database (dangerous_funcs.txt) and looks for presence of dangerous functions in the IDA Pro disassembly.  This is a really old script and not maintained.  

# Usage
Load the IDC script after you open the IDB or the executable in IDA pro.  Make sure that the IDC script and the txt file are in the same directory.
